In the context of web development, Front End Programming describes the process of designing what the customer sees when interacting with the programmers product. This means websites, app interfaces or even the screens on an ATM.
  
  Front End Programming draws the connection between the actions happening in the background and the graphical user interface. The referenced "actions in the background" are mostly part of Back End Programming, namely the logical coding, databases, hosting software, etc.
  
  In order to gather a general overview over needed skills for Front End Programming, coding languages and desing software should be studied. Coding languages mainly consist of HTML, CSS and Javascript and desing software could be Adobe Photoshop or Sketch.
 
 It is important to understand the role of browsers in todays World Wide Web.
  Web pages are built with HTML coding. The browsers role is to read given code and visualise it for the client. However, different browsers interpret HTML differently, which leads to problems with webpages being displayed differently throughout different browsers and different devices such as mobile phones.

### HTML
<div align="justify">
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is considered as the base of the World Wide Web. It was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 and has been further developed since by the World Wide Web Consortium and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group.


The purpose of a Markup Language is to structure text in documents so that it is syntactically differentiable.
Through the use of HTML, Front End programmers can structure text on their websites, but cant format it. HTML delivers information for the browsers how to work with the text that they should display and how exactly to display it. However, since there are many different browsers, every browser interprets HTML differently, which leads to websites sometimes looking differently on different browsers.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>title of website</title>
    <!-- more information on head -->
    <!-- comments arent shown in browsers. -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>content of website</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
1) **Declaration of type of document**  
   States which definition of the type of document (DTD) is being used.  
2) **HTML-head**  
   Contains technical or documentary Informations. Usually arent visivble in browser window.  
3) **HTML-body**  
   Contains information which is interpreted and shown by the browser.

### Javascript

#### Description
JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a dynamic and high-level programming language. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. Prior to this Netscape Communications partnered with Sun Microsystems to include their static programming language Java, because Netscape decided that the scripting language they want to create would complement Java, and to break the Microsoft monopoly for user adoption of Web technologies and platforms. JavaScript was called LiveScript when it got first released in September 1995 but it was renamed JavaScript in December 1995.
JavaScript was is the first client-side language and changed the world through the way to build the side of the site the user sees and interacts with. Before it, there were static HTML sites with no interactivity. 
Beside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is the most ubiquitous client-side language. If HTML dictates the content of a page, and CSS dictates the look and feel, JavaScript dictates the behavior of a page. JavaScript complements HTML and CSS due to changing content on the page and the way things look when a user interacts with it.
JavaScript is embedded right into the HTML of a page between <script> tags. An alternative way is to link an external JavaScript file, which is helpful if multiple pages are sharing the same chunks of code. 
Moreover JavaScript is a weakly-typed language, which means that JavaScript has not strict typing rules. It is object-oriented (prototype-based) and event-driven. 
To standardize JavaScript to foster multiple independent implementations, ECMAScript was created in 1997. ECMAScript is a scripting-language specification, which is standardized by ECMA International.
While JavaScript is a client-side language, some of its most powerful features involve asynchronous interaction with a remote server, which means that JavaScript is able to communicate with the server in the background without interrupting the user interaction taking place in the foreground.
With the Use of JavaScript it is possible to build a dynamic website, which is characterized by rollover effects and dropdown menus. Moreover new content and data can be loaded without reloading the page and animating page elements such as fading, resizing and relocating can be integrated. Playing audio and video and validating input from Web forms are other enhancements due to the use of JavaScript. In addition, browser compatibility issues can be repaired. 

#### Advantages
JavaScript is client-side and due to this it is very fast because it can be run immediately within the client-side browser. Moreover being client-side reduces the demand on the website server. Some JavaScript applications can even run without connecting back to a web server, which means they will work in a browser with or without an internet connection. 
Another Advantage of JavaScript is the simplicity. It is easy to learn and to implement compared to other languages. JavaScript enjoys a high popularity because it is used everywhere in the web. 
Through JavaScript it is possible to create a rich interface to a website, for example with drag and drop components or a slider.

#### Disadvantages
The client-side Security is not completely guaranteed, because the code executes on the users computer and in some cases it can be exploited for malicious purposes. This is a reason why some people choose to disable JavaScript.
Moreover JavaScript can be interpreted differently by different browsers, if no tool like JQuery, which handles all cross-browser inconsistencies and provides a consistent interface, is used.

#### Compilers
JavaScript can be compiled from code written in different languages through compilers like CoffeeScript and TypeScript.

##### Coffeescript
CoffeeScript is a language that compiles into JavaScript. It enables to write the code easier and up to 30% less coding lines. The code compiles into the equivalent JavaScript without interpretation at runtime. If the code is valid in JavaScript, it is valid in CoffeeScript.
Moreover CoffeeScript provides a more clearly syntax and it is more understandable than JavaScript. An Example of the difference is an automized declaration of the variables and optional brackets.

##### TypeScript
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript and it is Open Source. TypeScript runs on every browser, in Node.js or in any JavaScript engine that supports ECMAScript 3 or newer. It offers classes, modules, and interfaces to help you build robust components. If the code is valid in JavaScript, it is valid in TypeScript.
