In the context of web development, Front End Programming describes the process of designing what the customer sees when interacting with the programmers product. This means websites, app interfaces or even the screens on an ATM.
  
  Front End Programming draws the connection between the actions happening in the background and the graphical user interface. The referenced "actions in the background" are mostly part of Back End Programming, namely the logical coding, databases, hosting software, etc.
  
  In order to gather a general overview over needed skills for Front End Programming, coding languages and desing software should be studied. Coding languages mainly consist of HTML, CSS and Javascript and desing software could be Adobe Photoshop or Sketch.
 
 It is important to understand the role of browsers in todays World Wide Web.
  Web pages are built with HTML coding. The browsers role is to read given code and visualise it for the client. However, different browsers interpret HTML differently, which leads to problems with webpages being displayed differently throughout different browsers and different devices such as mobile phones.

### HTML
<div align="justify">
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is considered as the base of the World Wide Web. It was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 and has been further developed since by the World Wide Web Consortium and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group.


The purpose of a Markup Language is to structure text in documents so that it is syntactically differentiable.
Through the use of HTML, Front End programmers can structure text on their websites, but cant format it. HTML delivers information for the browsers how to work with the text that they should display and how exactly to display it. However, since there are many different browsers, every browser interprets HTML differently, which leads to websites sometimes looking differently on different browsers.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>title of website</title>
    <!-- more information on head -->
    <!-- comments arent shown in browsers. -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>content of website</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
1) **Declaration of type of document**  
   States which definition of the type of document (DTD) is being used.  
2) **HTML-head**  
   Contains technical or documentary Informations. Usually arent visivble in browser window.  
3) **HTML-body**  
   Contains information which is interpreted and shown by the browser.

## Designing in Front End
Designing Front End takes a big part of Front End development, since it influences the user highly. Most of today's strategies are build around UCDs (user-centered designs) and user experience is one of the biggest challenges. If the user is satisfied, the economy around it the product functions.
A big part to work on is responsiveness, as today's websites and web-applications need to scale well on every device with their own resolution. "Responsive design" is a term by Ethan Marcotte (2010) which describes the ability to respond on the technical requirements. Basic principles are: fluid grids (the arrangement transforms based on screen width and length), media queries (which control when to switch arrangements) and flexibility (flexible images and media scale based on their container).

There are best practices to meet the expections a user has:
- user focused design research (what does our user want?)
- reuse common design patterns (they work, don't reinvent the wheel!)
- consistency (design-wise and content-wise, use the same appearance and the same terminology!)
- communication (communicate with the user if something's changed, if they don't see progress, they get frustrated!)
